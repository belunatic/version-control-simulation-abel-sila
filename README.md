I followed the instructions of the assignment from cloning the repository to creating the branches.

I ran into a problem where my ```main branch``` was not on my local machine, and I had to create the ```main branch``` to perform the merging to the main branch task.

When I merged the two feature branches into the ```main branch```, I got a conflict that showed the element footer was used twice, and it caused the conflict. I had to manually resolve the conflict by picking the right solution. Staged the changes and committed them to the branch.

Then lastly, I pushed my main branch to the remote branch by running ```git push origin main```.

I did not have the opportunity to create a pull request on GitHub because there were no pull requests for me to create and merge, and maybe I am the owner of the repository.
